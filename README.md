A simple terminal-based game developed in Python for the course CS 11, University of the Philippines Diliman.

<h2>Game Description</h2>
Egg Roll is a 2D puzzle game where players tilt a grid to guide eggs into their nests. Navigate through walls, avoid frying pans, and use strategic moves to score points. Each level presents a unique challenge with a limited number of moves. The goal of the player is to score the most points.

<h3>Blocks</h3>
Throughout gameplay, players will encounter the following blocks:<br/>

 * üß± **Wall** - A solid barrier that cannot be passed through.<br/>
 * ü•ö **Egg** - The primary object to be moved. Players must roll the eggs to their destination while avoiding frying pans and other obstacles.<br/>
 * üü© **Grass** - Open and traversable space where eggs can roll freely.<br/>
 * ü™π **Empty nest** - When an egg reaches an empty nest, it fills the nest, converting it to a full nest, and points are awarded.<br/>
 * ü™∫ **Full nest** - Indicates a successfully filled nest. This also acts as a solid barrier.<br/>
 * üç≥ **Frying pan** - A hazardous block that fries any egg that lands on it, causing a point deduction.<br/>

<h2>Downloading and Installing the Game</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

 * Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. *Egg-roll* is compatible with Python 3.x versions. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). <br/>

<h3>Downloading the ZIP File</h3>

 `1.` On the right side of this repository, click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."<br/>
 `2.` Extract the ZIP file once the download is complete.<br/>

<h3>Installation</h3>

 `1.` Open your terminal or command propmpt.<br/>
 `2.` Navigate to the directory where you extracted the downloaded ZIP file.<br/>

```sh
cd path/to/extracted/egg-roll
```
 
*You may now proceed to the following step (Loading a Level)*

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<h3>Loading a Level</h3>

To load a level, use the following terminal command: `python3.12 egg_roll.py [filename]`.
Make sure that the level file is located in the same directory as the Python file.<br/>

**Example**<br/>

To load `level1.in`, run:

```sh
python3.12 egg_roll.py level1.in
```

<h3>Game Controls</h3>

The player can tilt the grid forward, backward, to the left, or to the right. Each tilt constitutes as a move. When prompted for an input, the player must enter moves either one at a time or several in sequence. The list of valid moves are:<br/>

 * `l` or `L`: Tilt the grid to the left.<br/>
 * `r` or `R`: Tilt the grid to the right.<br/>
 * `f` or `F`: Tilt the grid forwards (away from you).<br/>
 * `b` or `B`: Tilt the grid backwards (towards you).<br/>

**Sample**<br/>
Correct: `l`<br/>
Correct: `lblf`<br/>
Wrong: `n`<br/>
<br/>
 Invalid moves are simply ignored by the program.<br/>

<h3>Game Commands</h3>
Players may also enter these commands at any point of the game.<br/>

 * `RESTART` - Restarts the current game level. All progress in the current level will be reset, allowing players to start over.<br/>
 * `RETURN` - Exits the current game session and returns the player to the main menu.<br/>
 * `TERMINATE` - Ends the current game session and closes the game.<br/>
